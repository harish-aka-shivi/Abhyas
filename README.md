# Abhyas

## About:
This repo contains the work done while learning various languages and practicising algorithms and data Stuctures. It also 
contains projects i worked on while doing various moocs and understanding the computers better.

## Motivation
If we are not from the computer scince background its very necessary to get a grip on various cs fields 
and broaden the scope of knowledge. Working with various technologies and languages helps us become a better developer and architect our code better


Some of the links I follow for ideas and motivation:
* [Udacity](https://udacity.com)
* [Learn Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

## Index

* [Data structures implemention](https://github.com/harish-aka-shivi/Abhyas/tree/master/data_structures)

With every language having a collection library we never really have to figure out the implemantations of various data-structures.
But sometimes depending on our use case we can modify the standard implementation to really optimize the performance of programe.
So understanding the implementation goes a long way in our journey as software developer.

* [Search Engine](https://github.com/harish-aka-shivi/Abhyas/tree/master/mooc_projects/search_engine)

  * Fully working search engine made in python.
  * It implements the google's  page rank(initial implementation) algorithm to to refine the give the relevant searc reslts.

* [Blog](https://github.com/harish-aka-shivi/Abhyas/tree/master/misc_projects/Blog)
  * A fully featured(lacking fancy UI) blog services which allows users to maintain account,read blog posted by all the users and 
   it is desingned keeping scaling in mind.
  * It harness the power of Google App Engine to serve the content really effectively.
  * User Google Datastore to persist data and memcache to cache the content.

## TODOs

* Adding more theory to the Implementation of all the algorithms
* Adding implemetations of advanced datastructure and algorithms
* Adding more projects([More ideas](https://github.com/karan/Projects))
